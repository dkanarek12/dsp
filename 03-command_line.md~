###Q2.  List Files in Unix   

What do the following commands do:  
`ls`  
`ls -a`  
`ls -l`  
`ls -lh`  
`ls -lah`  
`ls -t`  
`ls -Glp`  

ls -a : lists all files/directories as well as files/directories within the directories
ls -l : lists properties of files/directories in the current directory
ls -lh : same as above byt file sizes are abbreviated

The -a and -l flag together will list the properties of all files in the cuurenty directory tree
